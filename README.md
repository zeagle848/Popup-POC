## Getting Started

Before we can start the live server we must first make sure that Node.js is installed. Check by opening your console and running `node -v`. If you can't see a version number you must install Node.js.

To view the app locally you can begin by installing the dependencies...

`npm install`

...and then start by running:

`npm run serve`.

The application should be live on `http://localhost:8080/` if it doesn't open automatically.
